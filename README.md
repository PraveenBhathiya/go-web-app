# Go Web Application with End-to-End DevOps Implementation

This repository showcases the complete implementation of DevOps practices for a Go-based web application. The project incorporates modern CI/CD, containerization, Kubernetes, Helm, and GitOps methodologies to automate the deployment lifecycle and ensure scalability and reliability.





## Project Overview

This project involves implementing an end-to-end DevOps pipeline for a Go-based web application. The process covers:

1.Containerization using Docker.

2.Kubernetes deployment and management.

3.CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions.

4.Helm chart integration for environment-specific deployments.

5.GitOps using Argo CD for automated delivery.

The application is a portfolio website that demonstrates the core functionalities of a modern Go application, including static content delivery and dynamic content rendering.
